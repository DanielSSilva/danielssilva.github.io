My name is Daniel Silva. I am a software engineer who works with .NET Core and Entity Framework Core, and SQL Server.

Ever since I've discovered the RaspberryPi, I've been doing a lot of projects with it, from gaming station (emulator), digital frame, up to control sensors with PowerShell.

I really enjoy to help the others and give back to the community whenever/however I can.

Feel free to contact me through the contacts at the bottom of this page.
