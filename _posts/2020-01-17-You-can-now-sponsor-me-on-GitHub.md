As you might be aware, GitHub launched [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors) a while back. 
The purpose is to provide a way for people to show appreciation towards open source developers, by sponsoring them, by giving money, for their work.

# Why is this any different from platforms like PayPal, Patreon, etc?

The good thing about this is that GitHub will [match your donations](https://help.github.com/en/github/supporting-the-open-source-community-with-github-sponsors/about-github-sponsors#about-the-github-sponsors-matching-fund) (up to $5k) for the first 12 months.
This means that the developer will receive double the amount you contribute with!

Also, you can display on your profile which developers you are sponsoring and who's sponsoring you. 
If you prefer, you can make your sponsorship to be private, so that others don't see.

# What will I do with the sponsors

I will quote what I've on my [sponsor profile page](https://github.com/sponsors/DanielSSilva):

>I'm a maintainer of the [Microsoft.PowerShell.IoT repository](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-IoT) and contribute to different repos with either docs changes, issues, feature requests.  
>I also have a [blog](https://danielssilva.dev) on which I share things that I find useful.  
>I've [started streaming ](https://www.twitch.tv/danielssilvadev), where I talk about PowerShell IoT, C# and IoT in general.    
>I do speak at conferences and user groups. You can find all of my recorded presentations [here](https://danielssilva.dev/references/).  
>Every contribution is well appreciated and will help dedicate more time to blogging, bring more content, as well as get more/better gear for the stream and my home office.  
>Here are some examples on what I'm planning to get (not by any specific order):
>* A raspberry Pi 4 4gb;
>* More sensors to show on stream, test, provide feedback;
>* Build a raspberry Pi cluster (require more Raspberry pi);
>* A better camera for streaming;
>* A standing desk;

# For how long do you have to sponsor someone?

That's another amazing thing about this: you can withdraw at any time! 
Want to send an "one time donation"? 
You can. 
Want to sponsor for only 6 months? No worries!

*Any* sort of donation is welcome (that's why I even have a tier with $1).
Furthermore, you can withdraw from your sponsorship at any time, no questions asked!

# Conclusion
This is a really good initiative from GitHub, and surely helps a lot of developers! If you want to show any sort of appreciation for my work, you know what you can do :)

Thanks for reading!
